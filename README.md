# Graph Neural Networks for Disease Prediction within the Department of Energy

## Abstract
We present a graph neural network to predict employee-level instances of multiple myeloma at Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration sites. Improved prediction of worker safety and health issues is important for preventative care, and a stated goal for the department as well. Our graph neural network model was trained on multiple myeloma data collected & aggregated from the study in Wing et al, 2000. The datasets in question were retrieved from the Department of Energyâ€™s Comprehensive Epidemiological Data Resource and represented operational data from the Manhattan project through 1979. The data was wrangled into a graph dataset representing employees, buildings, chemical agents & hazardous materials, and sites within the Department of Energy and the interactions between these distinct entities. Our convolutional graph neural network was trained on these data, and retrieved a classification accuracy of 93%.
